# Analysis of Property Assessment Change in Albany, New York

## Introduction/Objective

In May 2024, Albany County residents received a letter stating that a new property assessment had been conducted. The letter outlined changes in the assessed value of the property and the impact it will have on property taxes for the upcoming fiscal year. While some residents have been fortunate to pay the same or lower tax amounts, many have been left with jaw-dropping increases for their tax bills. 

In particular, this analysis aims to better understand the hidden nuances that are not direclty revealed by looking at individual properties. This study will aim to aggregate data across many different categories. These include, but is not limited to: zip code, neighborhoods, and school district. The study will also compare newly assessed property values with nearby recently sold homes data. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to verify if the new property assessments have been conducted fairly/equitably.

## Description

#### Research Questions

There are two questions to formulate hypothesis' from. For each question it will look as follows:


1. Did property assessments increase at the same percentage rate by neighborhood? By Zip Code? By School District?
    - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in property tax increase.
    - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is significant difference in property tax increase.

2. If property taxes did not increase at the same rate, was it different for low-income communities? _(Low-Income Communities to be identified using Census Data and comparing it to 2024 HUD thresholds)_
    - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in property tax increase.
    - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is significant difference in property tax increase.
